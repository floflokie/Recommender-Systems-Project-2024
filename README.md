## Data Collection and Preprocessing
First, I downloaded the MovieLens dataset from the [MovieLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). I used the `ml-latest-small.zip` file, which contains a small subset of the full dataset. The dataset includes ratings, movies, and tags.
I also downloaded the IMDb dataset from the [IMDb Datasets website](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). I used the `title.basics.tsv.gz` file, which contains information about movies, including genres and directors. I merged the two datasets to include movie ratings, genres, and metadata.
